Read the Game Requirement Document. When you are ready, do step 1

remove the spining cube

I do not see the grass field?

test passed.

proceed to step 2

make the camera a first person camera

Now the WASD keys no longer work

test passed. to the next step

Everything work fine until I try pressing the Q or E keys

Still bugged. But now it seem like the camera only rotated onec per press, instead of keep rotating while holding the key

the screen still flickering after I press Q or E once

swap Q and E's rotation direction

it seem that I am limited to rotating only 90 degree in either direction? Make it so that I can rotate all around in either direction

Still has the same problem. It seem that once I reach the rotate limit, the screen keep flickering between rotaating further and stay at the limit?

still flickering

still flickering

Now it's getting worse. Can you revert it to before the most recent change?

Alright.

make the camera start looking straight toward the wall

test passed. next step.

Can you put a black outline on the wall?

swap Q and E

test passed. next step

test passed. next step

make the zombie look at the player

test passed. next step.

now I cannot move, and the zombie disappear

make the zombie also stop movin toward the player once it come in contact with the player, like the wall. But makeit so that it will still chase the player if the player run away

test passed. next step

add a fist to show the attacking & charging

I currently still cannot see the fist. Maybe adjusting the fist's position so that it will be visible on the camera? It doesnt need to actually connect to the body

animate the fist based on how much the attack is charged

only animate the fist expanding while charging, remove the 'moving the fist forward' part

test passed. next step

player's health keep decreasing after the zombie is dead

it seem that the zombie's hitbox still exist after it's dead

test passed. let's stop here for today

would it be easier for you to implementing other steps if app.js was to be seperated into multiple files?

refactor app.js

what to do with app.js now?

I commented app.js. and now nothing get rendered?

do I need to includ all file in here?

only the sky is rendered

It seem like you(copilot) can only see one of my file at a time?

 i will just put everything in the same file then. So that you can reference everything

Alright, let's continue.

are you sure?

proceed

can the fist be a circle instead?

make it so that the fist only go forward when attacking, and not while charging

change the fist's color to be light brown, like a human skin

make it so that the fist expand slower, reaching full size at max charge

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

make it so that zombie always leave a corpse, regardless of if the red tile or the player kill it

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

it seem that after the zombie is dead, its htibox still exist

it seem that currently zombie can damage player by either touching the player, or by doing the delayed attack. Remove the 'damage by touching' part

it seem that curently the zombie stop before the player is within its attack range?

make the zombie's attack range slightly longer

remove the red tile

give zombie arms, then animate the arms when the zombie attack

the zombie does not colid with the wall

the zombie's hitbox still exist after death. remove it after the zombie's death

the zombie's hitbox still exists after its death, and it can still chase and attack the player. fix it

make the zombie's arms point forward

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

it seem that some of the variable names you use here are already used in my current code

make the bat handle shorter, and the bat head longer, like a baseball bat

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

the bat was picked up, but the bat icon did not appear

can you make the slot say 'baseball bat' or 'bat' instead of using an image as an icon?

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

your edit to "window.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {...})" seem to be incompatible with my current code?

the bat now function as an weapon. But it still use the fist's animation

make it so that when the player select the baseball bat, the fist change into a baseball bat, or a hand holding the bat

add animation to the bat while attacking & charging

test passed. what is the next step?

proceed

it seem that only some zombies can be hit by attack?

refractor how zombies are currently handled so that it will be easier for the game to handle: 1)multiple zombies at the same time 2)adding more zombies in the middle of the game 3)new functions relate to zombies being add down the line in the code

Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'zombieManager' before initialization

the class zombieManager is initialized at line 777. There's an animate() function at line 740.

there are currently 2 animate() functions. One before line 777, and one after line 777. Read the code and tell me if any of the two instances of animate() can be delete or not

now the player cannot attack the zombies

Uncaught TypeError: zombieManager.handleZombieDeath is not a function

rotate the player's camera's starting direction by 180 degree

update each zombies's health bar to match their health

can everything relate to 'zombieGroup', 'zombieGroup2', and 'zombieGroup3' be removed?

app.js:475 Uncaught ReferenceError: zombieHealthBar is not defined

randomize each zombie's shirt's color when they are created

make it so that each zombies colides with each other

make it so that, when a zombie is knocked back, it is only knocked back as far as it can without coliding with anything. So if it's suppose to be knocked back 30 unit, but there is a wall 20 unit behind it, it will only get knocked back 20 unit

Test passed.

What is the next step?

what was the last step you did before this?

No. The last step you did was "Add 2 more zombies next to the first one.". What is the next step?

proceed

make it so that if a zombie die in the middle of its attacking animation, that attack is canceled

both bats currently have no animation. Make an animation that all weapons outside from the fist shared and use?

Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'weaponManager' before initialization

app.js:848 Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'WeaponManager' before initialization

currently the scene is just black. But the console display no error

make the camera a first person view of the player

the player can no longer move

try to do the "Refactor the weapons system" step again. This time, try to make it so that both baseball bats use the same function for detecting if they get picked up or not

skip step 21. What is the next step?

proceed

test passed. what is the next step?

skip that step

proceed

now the zombies do not attack. fix it

I edited the zombieAttack() function. check if it still function as intended or not

Uncaught ReferenceError: attackDuration is not defined

add the ability to restart the game by pressing the Enter key at the game over screen

the game can restart. But the 'game over' text box stayed

test passed. let's stop here for today

let's continue. What is the next step?

proceed

app.js:362 Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'fenceBoundingBoxes' before initialization

make it so that if a zombie cannot move because of another zombie, it will try to knock that zombie away a little bit

double the fence's height

remove the stone wall

make all fences actually reach each other at the corner

extend the fences so that they will cover the corner

app.js:1017 Uncaught TypeError: THREE.VectorVector3 is not a constructor

make the zombie's corpse the same color as their shirt

test passed. What is the next step?

proceed

remove the baseball bat

test passed. What is the next step?

proceed

test passed. What is the next step?
