When you are ready, do step 1

6410615063: remove the spining cube

6410615063: I do not see the grass field?

6410615063: test passed.

6410615063: proceed to step 2

6410615063: make the camera a first person camera

6410615063: Now the WASD keys no longer work

6410615063: test passed. to the next step

6410615063: Everything work fine until I try pressing the Q or E keys
Pressing either of them seem to cause the screen to rapidly change between 2 rotation?

6410615063: Still bugged. But now it seem like the camera only rotated onec per press, instead of keep rotating while holding the key

6410615063: the screen still flickering after I press Q or E once

6410615063: swap Q and E's rotation direction

6410615063: it seem that I am limited to rotating only 90 degree in either direction? Make it so that I can rotate all around in either direction

6410615063: Still has the same problem. It seem that once I reach the rotate limit, the screen keep flickering between rotaating further and stay at the limit?

6410615063: still flickering

6410615063: still flickering

6410615063: Now it's getting worse. Can you revert it to before the most recent change?

6410615063: Alright.
Currently, if I let the direction I started in be 0 degree, I can only rotate to 90 and -90 degree.
Once I reach 90 degree, trying to rotate more seem like it keep making the screen switch between 91 and 90 degree.
How to fix that?

6410615063: make the camera start looking straight toward the wall

6410615063: test passed. next step.

6410615063: Can you put a black outline on the wall?

6410615063: swap Q and E

6410615063: test passed. next step

6410615063: test passed. next step

6410615063: make the zombie look at the player

6410615063: test passed. next step.

6410615063: now I cannot move, and the zombie disappear

6410615063: make the zombie also stop movin toward the player once it come in contact with the player, like the wall. But makeit so that it will still chase the player if the player run away

6410615063: test passed. next step

6410615063: add a fist to show the attacking & charging

6410615063: I currently still cannot see the fist. Maybe adjusting the fist's position so that it will be visible on the camera? It doesnt need to actually connect to the body

6410615063: animate the fist based on how much the attack is charged

6410615063: only animate the fist expanding while charging, remove the 'moving the fist forward' part

6410615063: test passed. next step

6410615063: player's health keep decreasing after the zombie is dead

6410615063: test passed. let's stop here for today

6410615063: would it be easier for you to implementing other steps if app.js was to be seperated into multiple files?

6410615063: what to do with app.js now?

6410615063: I commented app.js. and now nothing get rendered?

6410615063: do I need to includ all file in here?

6410615063: only the sky is rendered

6410615063: It seem like you(copilot) can only see one of my file at a time?

6410615063:  i will just put everything in the same file then. So that you can reference everything
