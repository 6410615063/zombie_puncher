Idea
    a 3D game
    control without using mouse
    a guy trying to decend a dungeon, fending off zombies using weapons he found
    the dungeon is randomly generated
    each dungeon floor consist of:
        rooms
        zombies
        weapons
        a stair leading to the next floor
        health potion?
    charging up attack using the space key, release the key to attack, dealing damage & knockback based on charge
    the zombies chase the player and perform a delayed attack at close range, dealing damage
    the game is endless, end when the player run out of health
    has a score system based on amount of zombies killed and amount of floors decended

Step-by-Step Implementation plan
    You must only perform these instruction one step at a time
    After you are done, I will perform the test to validate your work
    If your work pass the test, I will then tell you to perform the next step
    
    1. make & render a 3D game with a grass field, a light blue sky, and a single stone wall
        Test: I must see a grass field, a blue sky, and a stone wall
    2. add player movement using the WSAD/Arrow keys for movement
        - multiple keys must be able to be pressed at the same time (including key actions implemented at later steps)
        Test: I will try using the WASD and Arrow keys
    3. add player camera rotation using Q and E keys. 
        - Q to rotate counterclockwise.
        - E to rotate clockwise
        Test: I will try to use the Q and E keys
    4. add player and wall hitbox. Player must be able to colide with the wall
        Test: I will try to run at the stone wall
    5. add a zombie in front of the wall. Dark green skin, orange shirt, and brown pants
        Test: I will look at the zombie
    6. add zombie movement. 
        - Make the zombie chase the player
        - Make the zombie slower than the player
        Test: I will try to walk away from the zombie
    7. add hitbox to the zombie.
        - The zombie must be able to colide with both the player and the wall
        Test: I will try to make the zombie run at the wall
    8. add punching graphic. Like how a FPS game would do for melee attack
        - display a fist at the right side of the screen
        - holding the Space key pull the fist back
        - If the fist is fully charged, it will start shaking. Slightly but visible
        - release the Space key launch the fist forward, then retract it back to normal position
        Test: I will try to move around, rotating the camera, and press the Space key
    9. add health to both the player and zombie
        - display the player's health bar at the top left corner of the screen
        - display the zombie's health bar at the top of its head
        - player's health bar is more detailed
        - zombie's health bar can just be a line (thick enough to be visible)
        Test: I will look for these health bar
    10. add a red tile behind the player
        Test: I will look for it
    11. add damage & death system
        - when the player or zombie step on the red tile, they take damage
        - if the zombie run out of health, it dies, leaving behind a corpse
        - the player's health bar must update alongside the player's health
        - if the player run out of health, the game stop, and the "game over" screen show up
        Test: I will try to make both the player and zombie walk over the red tile
    12. add zombie attack animation
        - when the zombie get close enough to the player, it will stop moving, and try to punch the player
        Test: I will try to get attacked by the zombie
    13. make the screen red when getting hitbox
        - give the screen a light red filter for a second when the player take damage
        Test: I will try to take damage (zombie and red tile)
    14. add damage to zombie's attack
        Test: I will try to get hit by the zombie
    15. make the player's punch damage the zombie
        - the player's punching range should be slightly longer than the zombie
        Test: I will try to punch the zombie
    16. add a baseball bat leaning on the wall
        Test: I will look for it
    17. add an inventory system & display
        - add an inventory hotbar at the center bottom of the screen
        - number key (1-9) can be used to cycle between each inventory slot
        - key 0 make the player use their fist
        Test: I will try using the number keys
    18. allow the baseball bat to be picked up by player
        - player pick up the weapon when they touch it
        - once picked up, the bat disappear from the wall, and appear in the inventory
        Test: I will try to pick the baseball bat up
    19. allow the baseball bat to be used as a weapon for attacking
        - the bat do more damage than punching
        - the bat has more range than punching
        - the bat has its own charging & attacking animation
        Test: I will try it out
    20. add 2 more zombies next to the first one
        Test: I will play the game
    21. refractor the weapons system
        - change the way weapons is implemented so that it is easier to add more weapons
        - make fist count as a weapons
        - when a weapon is picked up, it goes to the leftmost empty slot (from 1 to 9)
        - add another baseball bat behind the wall, it has the same stats as the first baseball bat
        Test: I will try to collect each bat in any order I want
    22. refractor the inventory system
        - put fist in slot 1 instead
        - remove the 0 key's function
    23. add a durability system to weapon
        - a weapon's durability goes down when you land an attack with it (except for fist)
        - the weapon disappear when it ran out of durability
        - add a durability bar below player health bar. It must display the durability of the selected weapon
        Test: I will play the game
    24. add a score system
        - gain score when killing zombie
        - add a score display at the top right corner of the screen
        - show current score & high score at the game over screen
        Test: I will look for it
    25. surround the grass field with wooden fences
        - the fences should only be half as tall as the player
        - the fences should prevent the player from leaving the grass field
        Test: I will try to leave the grass field
    26. spawn more zombies after every current zombies are dead
        - increase the amount spawned with the current score
        - spawn them far from the player enough that the player do not get attacked right away
        Test: I will try to kill all zombies
    27. add a crosshair at the center of the screen
        - the crosshair should change color to orange when a zombie is within player's attack range, then change back
        - the crosshair should change color to red if a zombie was hit by an attack, then change back
        Test: I will try to play the game
